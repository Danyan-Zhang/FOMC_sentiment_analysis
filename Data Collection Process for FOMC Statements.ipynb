    "- On the Federal Reserve's monetary policy website (url1 and url2), there is a lot of ULRs link to the content besides the FOMC statements, such as links to implementation notes and press conference videos.

A quick way to obtain these URLs is by extracting the pattern of the statement URLs and using this pattern to find all matching URLs.\n",
